# machine-learning
An example showing how the scikit-learn can be used to recognize images of hand-written digits.
In this project, a dataset consist of 1797 different had-written digits were used for recognizing the hand-written digits.
The SVM classifier was used for classification and Grid Search method was used also for determining the best SVM kernel.
Finally the confusion matrix and classification report displayed the best results.
